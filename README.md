**Business Context**

This dataset consists of tv shows and movies available on Netflix as of 2019. The
dataset is collected from Flixable which is a third-party Netflix search engine. In
2018, they released an interesting report which shows that the number of TV shows
on Netflix has nearly tripled since 2010. The streaming service's number of movies
has decreased by more than 2,000 titles since 2010, while its number of TV shows
has nearly tripled. It will be interesting to explore what all other insights can be
obtained from the same dataset.
Integrating this dataset with other external datasets such as IMDB ratings, rotten
tomatoes can also provide many interesting findings.

In this project, you are required to do
*   Exploratory Data Analysis
*   Understanding what type content is available in different countries
If Netflix has been increasingly focusing on TV rather than movies in
recent years.
*   Clustering similar content by matching text-based features
